RouteSavvy API is an easy to use REST service for optimizing driving stop order. RSAPI.svc allows both GET and POST options. Requests use JSON formatted strings and results are returned in JSON format for optimal use in web applications.

The optimized results return stops ordered for the most efficient driving route. Results include turn by turn directions for reach route leg and a latitude, longitude polyline describing the route for use in map visualization.

RouteSavvy Json Plus API provides additional features including "Time Windows" and "Multi Vehicle" capabilities to the standard RouteSavvy Json API,  ( https://github.com/onterra/Example-RouteSavvyJsonAPI).
